# Please consider using an ATECCx08 or NervesKey rather than storing serial
# numbers in U-Boot environment blocks. Override this file in your project's
# rootfs_overlay directory and uncomment the following line if you go this
# route:
# -b nerves_key -f /dev/i2c-1

# Default: use cpuinfo.
-b cpuinfo
